Name: Brasington, Frank L
Assignment: 3

It is possible to have the test case functions disjoint or incomplete. My first time thru I did not have my test
case functions disjointed when I worked on this in assignment 2. It simply didn't occur to me to do that. This time
around I have made my test disjointed and here is how I did it.
1: no zero contained in an array larger than 1
2: 1 zero contained in array larger than 1
3: more than 1 zero contained in array larger than 1
4: no zero in a size 1 array (added to test the correction made to the code worked)
5: zero in a size 1 array (added to test the the corection made to the code)

Advantages:
The advantages of having the input disjoint test cases are the following:
1:Limits the area of testing. If the testing isn't limited then the number of tests will start to grow out of control
2:It's easy to see what conditions caused the test to fail. 
3:The testing can be applied to different levels of testing
4:This testing is easy to apply with no automation
