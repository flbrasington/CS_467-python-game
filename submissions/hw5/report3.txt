	the nextHand() fucntion in the Player.java file set's the player's wallet to null each time the function
	is called. 

Effects on Game:
	The player has 2 problems. First is that each time the player finishes a round his wallet is set to Null and
	the player is unable to contiue playing. 

Test Code Snippet:
		Player p = new Player();
		p.nextHand();
		assertNotEquals("Player: []w nullb nulli null", p.toString());;

	public void nextHand() {
		currentBet = null;
		currentWallet = null;
		currentInsurance = null;
	}
