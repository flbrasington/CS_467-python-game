Part 1:
1: The red line seems to be for conditions statments such as in what I looked at:
if(dealerScore<hadScore(p.getHand())){}. The number seems to indicate the number of times
that this condition statment is ran.

2:  Interfaces how how objects in java interact with the outside world. I believe that the interfaces
are marked as N/A because we can't test the interface only the source code for functions.

3:  The problem with a function like testBasicFunctionality is that it's vague and not well defined. The
test can be broken up into smaller testing segments. A better test would be break up testBasicFunctionality
into testDeck, testPlayersHand, and so on.

4:  The number of if/else statements will increase the number of branches to be covered. Each if/else statment
will make a new path that will be required to be covered. The more if/else statments the more branches there
are for coverage.
